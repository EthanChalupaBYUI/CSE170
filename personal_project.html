    <h1>
        What is your Style?
    </h1>
    <p>
        I like working in a small team of people I know. I like knowing my purpose in a team and what the teams purpose is.
    </p>
    <h1>
        When do you like people to approach you and how?
    </h1>
    <P>
        Preferably when I'm not doing something else, but I really dont mind. I like it when people respect me when they talk to me.
    </P>
    <h1>
        How do you like people to communicate with you?
    </h1>
    <p>
        I prefer longer questions face to face, and short questions in a text or email.
    </p>
    <h1>
        How do you make decisions?
    </h1>
    <p>
        I like to think that I think broadly with the consequenses in mind when I make decisions.
    </p>
    <h1>
        How can people help you?
    </h1>
    <p>
        This changes on a per task basis, but I like help and work well in a team when the task requires it.
    </p>
    <h1>
        What will you not tolerate in others?
    </h1>
    <p>
        I severly dislike it when people get in my way due to malicous intent or intentional ignorance. Other than that not much gets to me.
